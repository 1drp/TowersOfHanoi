# TowersOfHanoi

Recursive function to solve the classic towers of Hanoi problem:

Given three towers with n rings of varying sizes:
	The rings begin on the first tower.
	Move all rings from the first tower to the third.
	You can only move one ring at a time.
	No ring can ever be above another ring that is smaller.

Each tower is represented by a struct providing a tower number and a stack showing it's rings.
